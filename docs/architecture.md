# Architecture

The public release branch is a TypeScript monorepo organized around one browser-focused runner pipeline.

## Package Boundaries

### `packages/replay-schema`

Shared contracts for:

- scenario manifests
- run start requests and responses
- replay bundle metadata
- SSE event payloads
- structured runner errors

If an HTTP route or UI state is public, its shape should be defined here first.

### `packages/scenario-kit`

Scenario manifests and default prompts for the three public labs:

- kanban
- paint
- booking

This package is the public scenario registry. Adding a new scenario starts here.

### `packages/browser-runtime`

Thin Playwright session abstraction for:

- launching the browser
- resolving the start target
- reading browser state
- capturing screenshots

It does not know about scenario prompts, verification, or the Responses API.

### `packages/runner-core`

Core orchestration for:

- mutable run workspaces
- run lifecycle management
- the Responses API loop
- scenario executors
- verification

`src/responses-loop.ts` is the canonical sample for the Responses API integration in this repo.

### `apps/runner`

Fastify HTTP layer for:

- `POST /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs/:id`
- `POST /api/runs/:id/stop`
- `GET /api/runs/:id/events`
- `GET /api/runs/:id/replay`
- scenario reset and screenshot artifact routes

This app should stay thin. The logic belongs in `runner-core`.

### `apps/demo-web`

Next.js operator console for:

- selecting a scenario
- starting and stopping runs
- reviewing streamed activity
- scrubbing captured screenshots
- surfacing actionable runner guidance

The UI is split into a hook (`useRunStream`) plus focused presentational components.

## Runtime Flow

1. The operator console requests the public scenario registry from the runner.
2. Starting a run asks `RunnerManager` to create a mutable workspace and replay bundle.
3. `RunnerManager` selects a scenario executor through `executor-registry.ts`.
4. The executor launches the lab and hands control to `responses-loop.ts`.
5. The loop emits events, screenshots, and final verification results back into the replay bundle.
6. The web app reads the run detail and follows SSE updates until the run finishes.

## Extensibility

The public branch intentionally exposes only three scenarios, but the architecture is meant to be forked:

- add a manifest in `scenario-kit`
- add a verifier and instructions in `runner-core`
- register the executor in `executor-registry.ts`
- add a lab template under `labs`

That path is documented in [docs/contributing.md](./contributing.md).
